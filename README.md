# Server Info Package

This package provides a set of key information about your server in order to view it to the user.

## Installation

```php
composer require somarkn99/host-info
```

```

Usage
-------
After you Install package and upload to you host, you will have this route:

```php
www.your-domain.com/api/server/info
```

When you request the endpoint it will return array:

- Server_OS
- Server_Software
- Server_IP
- Server_Port
- Server_Country
- Server_City
- Server_Hostname
- Document Root
- Total_CPUs
- Total_Ram
- PHP_Version
- PHP_Max_Upload_Size
- PHP_Max_Execution_Time
- PHP_Short_Tag
- PHP_Memory_Limit

Where you can use this ? :thinking:	
-------
The idea for this came when one of my clients asked me to access the basic server information from the control panel, now you can show it to the user easily instead of writing it in every new project from the beginning.

Note :warning:	
-------
Not all of these codes have to be from my pure work, there are many of them on the Internet that I may have done some but not limited to some modification, improvement, or modification of the appearance of the code to become readable, understandable or appropriate to the place of use.
If you have any code you think will be useful and people will use frequently in many projects do not hesitate to do a pull request to this repo.
